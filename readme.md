# Copy Files

## 🎮 About the Project
I wrote an application that allows copying files from one specified location to another. The app uses Node.js to interact with the file system and handles the copying process.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Node.js** (For building the application and interacting with the file system)

## 🛠️ Tools & Dependencies
- **ESLint** – For maintaining code quality and consistency  
- **Prettier** – For automatic code formatting  
- **Jest** – For testing the file copying functionality  

## 📌 Features
✅ Allows specifying source and destination locations for file copying  
✅ Provides a simple command-line interface for interaction  
✅ Includes error handling for invalid paths or file issues  

## 🌐 Demo
To run the app, clone the repository and execute the file copy operation locally using Node.js.
